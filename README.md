# Animated TypeScript and React reusable component

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) using the `--template typescript` parameter for Typescript configuration.

## Before running the app:

```bash
npm i
# Or you can also do:
yarn
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
To run it silently add this to the `test` script: `--watchAll=false`
Or just run it using: `npm test -- --watchAll=false`

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
